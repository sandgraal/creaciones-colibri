## 2. Content Production Workflow

2. **Asset creation:**
   - Photo/Video: Capture high-resolution imagery biweekly; store in shared Drive under `/Marketing/Raw Assets/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
   - Graphics: Use Figma templates in `docs/design/` for Stories, Pinterest pins, and downloadable guides.
   - Copywriting: Draft long-form posts in the blog, then adapt for captions and newsletters.
3. **Localization:** Produce Spanish captions and subtitles for priority assets (Weeks 1, 3, 6, 8, 12). Use existing glossary in `src/_data/i18n/ui.es.json` to stay on-brand.
4. **Approvals:** Marketing lead reviews copy + design 48 hours before publish; founders sign off on giveaways or collaborations.
5. **Analytics:** Track campaign performance in weekly stand-up using Plausible (web), Instagram Insights, and Snipcart conversions. Feed highlights into `docs/operations/analytics-plan.md` once Plausible is live.
