# Post-Launch Marketing Playbook

This is a lightweight guide for the two of us to keep launch momentum once the storefront is live. Treat it as a menu of ideas—we can scale effort up or down depending on bandwidth and traction.

## 1. Campaign Cadence

Use the calendar as inspiration—if a week feels overloaded, skip it and pick up where the energy is strongest.

## 2. Content Workflow

1. Maintain a simple tracker (Notion doc, spreadsheet, or markdown checklist) with publish dates, asset needs, and status.
2. Batch shoot photo/video content twice a month; file assets under `docs/design/` or a dated folder in cloud storage.
3. Draft long-form copy in the blog first, then adapt into captions, newsletter blurbs, and translated snippets.
4. Aim to produce Spanish captions or subtitles for the flagship assets each month. Reuse terms from `src/_data/i18n/es.json` to stay consistent.
5. Before publishing, give copy and visuals a fresh read the day prior—no formal approval queue needed.

## 3. Partnerships & Collaborations

- **Chef or mixologist features:** Reach out to local creators (Miami, San José, etc.) for quarterly recipe videos. Offer a bundle, a small stipend (~$250), and cross-promotion. Capture high-res stills during the shoot for press use.
- **Wellness studios & retreats:** Pitch the Wellness Reset Kit as a welcome gift. Provide co-branded signage or QR codes pointing to the subscription page. Follow up afterward for a testimonial.
- **Farm spotlights:** Interview ingredient suppliers once a month. Turn notes into bilingual blog posts and invite partners to take over Instagram Stories when schedules allow.

## 4. Community & Feedback Loops

- Send a short post-purchase email 7 days after delivery (three-question survey about flavor, packaging, gifting). Offer 10% off the next purchase as an incentive.
- Feature user-generated content twice a month. Offer $15 store credit or a shout-out for selected reels/recipes.
- Keep a simple spreadsheet of competitor launches, trending flavors, and ingredient ideas. Review monthly and decide whether any concepts deserve prototyping.
- Capture recurring customer questions (email, DM, form submissions) and convert the best ones into FAQ snippets or quick blog posts.

## 5. Metrics Snapshot

Review these numbers weekly or bi-weekly—whatever cadence fits our schedule:

- Website sessions overall plus key paths (`/products/`, `/bundles/`, `/blog/`).
- Snipcart orders, conversion rate, and average order value.
- Newsletter subscriber delta (including campaign-specific opt-ins).
- Platform engagement (reach, saves, shares, replies) for Instagram/TikTok.
- Subscription retention metrics once renewals go live.
- Earned-media mentions or partner shout-outs (log them in this file or a shared doc).

Add a short summary each month—wins, learnings, what to double down on—so the implementation plan and roadmap stay grounded in real data.
