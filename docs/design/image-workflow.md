# Image Workflow & Placeholders

This guide explains how we manage product imagery while we gather final photography.

## 1. Placeholder Strategy
- Each product uses an SVG gradient stored in `src/img/products/`. The filenames match the product IDs for clarity.
- SVGs are lightweight, responsive, and compatible with our Eleventy build; replace them with `.webp` or optimized `.png` assets when final photos are available.
- Keep descriptive alt text in `src/_data/products.js` even for placeholders so assistive technologies convey context.

## 2. Replacing with Final Photography
1. Export product shots at multiple widths (e.g., 480px, 960px, 1440px) and convert to `.webp`.
2. Place the files in `src/img/products/` and update the `image.src` path in the corresponding product entry.
3. Add responsive markup later (e.g., `srcset`) once we finalize template updates; placeholders ensure layout remains stable meanwhile.

## 3. Optimization Tips
- Use [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) or `cwebp` CLI for compression.
- Target file sizes under 200 KB for hero imagery and under 150 KB for product cards.
- Maintain consistent framing (centered product on neutral background) to reinforce brand cohesion.

## 4. Favicon & Logo Variants (TODO)
- Create favicon set and responsive logos; store under `src/img/branding/`. Update `implementation_plan.md` once completed.
