# Shipping & Packaging Strategy

This guide outlines recommendations for domestic and international fulfillment, sustainable packaging, and next steps. Revisit quarterly as rates or suppliers change.

## 1. Shipping Overview

### Domestic (United States)
- **Primary carrier: USPS** — Priority Mail Cubic for sauces/jars up to 20 lb (2–3 day average, tracking included). Estimated $8–$12 per parcel depending on zone.
- **Backup carrier: UPS Ground** — Better for larger wholesale orders (>10 lb) or multi-case shipments; integrates with Shopify/Snipcart easily.
- **Optional add-on:** Insure parcels valued over $50 (approx. $1.50 per $100 declared value).

### International (Costa Rica → US & US → International)
- **USPS Priority Mail International** — 6–10 day delivery with tracking; ~ $35 for 1 kg package. Good for occasional consumer orders.
- **DHL Express Worldwide** — Faster (3–5 days) with customs brokerage support; higher base cost (~$55 for 1 kg) but discounted via EasyShip/Shippo accounts.
- **Customs prep:** Include ingredient list with Spanish/English labeling; ensure sauces meet local regulations (declare vinegar-based shelf-stable products).

### Fulfillment Tools
- Use a shipping platform (Pirate Ship, Shippo) to compare carrier rates and generate labels.
- Configure dimensional weight templates: 9×6×3 in mailer for single sauce/jar; 12×9×4 in mailer for bundles; 14×10×6 in box for six-pack samplers.

## 2. Packaging & Sustainability

- **Primary container:** Compostable padded mailers (e.g., noissue, EcoEnclose) for single jars/sachets; cost ~$1.05 per unit at 100 quantity.
- **Box option:** Recycled corrugate boxes with compostable water-activated tape for larger bundles; expect ~$1.60 per box at 100 quantity.
- **Void fill:** Mushroom packaging or recycled paper crinkle; avoid plastic bubble wrap. Allocate ~$0.45 per shipment.
- **Insulation:** For heat-sensitive products, include plant-based insulated liners (temperatures >85°F). Approx. $1.80 each.
- **Labeling:** Soy-based inks, FSC-certified paper for stickers; ensure materials survive moisture during transit.

## 3. Cost Snapshot (per order)

| Shipment | Packaging | Carrier (avg) | Total Estimated |
| -------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------------|
| Single 5 oz sauce (US) | Compostable mailer + glass bottle protector (~$1.50) | USPS PM Cubic Zone 4 (~$8.75) | ~$10.25 |
| Sauce trio (US) | Recycled box + filler (~$2.20) | USPS PM Cubic Zone 7 (~$11.40) | ~$13.60 |
| Granola + tea kit (US) | Box + liner (~$2.60) | UPS Ground regional (~$9.85) | ~$12.45 |
| International 1 kg | Compostable box + filler (~$2.60) | USPS PMI (~$35.00) | ~$37.60 |

Adjust pricing as negotiated rates improve. Track actual spend per shipment to refine the model.

## 4. Action Items

1. Set up Pirate Ship or Shippo account and import product catalog dimensions.
2. Order packaging samples from EcoEnclose/noissue to validate fit and durability.
3. Build a shipping rate table for the storefront (e.g., flat $8 US shipping, free over $75; tiered international pricing).
4. Draft customs/compliance checklist for sauces entering Costa Rica, EU, and Canada.
5. Review sustainable packaging certifications (BPI, OK compost) for marketing claims.
