  <h1>Bienvenidos a nuestra cocina creativa</h1>
  <p>We started Creaciones Colibrí to capture the flavors we grew up with in Costa Rica and the new ingredients we cultivate in our Florida backyard. This journal will chronicle the recipes, farmers, and regenerative makers who inspire every batch.</p>
  <p>Expect behind-the-scenes fermentation notes, ideas for cooking with our sauces and snacks, and profiles of the growers who share our values. If you want a first look at new products, make sure you join our newsletter — we announce limited releases there first.</p>
  <h2>What's coming next</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Flavor tests of the next seasonal hot sauce, featuring smoked pineapple and guava.</li>
    <li>Granola experiments that layer adaptogens, crunchy textures, and zero-waste sweeteners.</li>
    <li>Field notes from our partners in Turrialba and the Caribbean coast, where regenerative farming is transforming communities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thank you for being part of this flock. If there's a recipe or ingredient you'd like us to explore, send us a note at <a href="mailto:hola@creacionescolibri.com">hola@creacionescolibri.com</a>.</p>
