# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 22 October 2025_

Creaciones Colibrí respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the safeguards we maintain for our community.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Contact Forms
- **Data collected:** Name, email address, and message content submitted through the Formspree contact form.
- **How we use it:** Respond to inquiries, wholesale requests, and collaboration proposals.
- **Storage:** Formspree retains submissions. We export or delete messages within 90 days unless an ongoing conversation requires longer retention.

### 1.2 Newsletter Signup
- **Data collected:** Email address submitted through the homepage newsletter form.
- **How we use it:** Send product updates, launch announcements, recipes, and marketing campaigns.
- **Storage:** Managed by our email marketing provider (e.g., Mailchimp or ConvertKit). Subscribers can unsubscribe at any time via the link in each message.

### 1.3 E-Commerce Checkout (Snipcart)
- **Data collected:** Shipping and billing details, order contents, and payment method tokens handled by Snipcart and connected gateways (Stripe, PayPal).
- **How we use it:** Fulfil orders, process payments, issue refunds, and provide customer support.
- **Storage:** Snipcart stores order data under their privacy policy. Payment details are processed by the gateway; we never store raw card numbers.

### 1.4 Analytics (Plausible)
- **Data collected:** Aggregated page views, referral sources, device/browser information, and approximate geography. Plausible does not use cookies or store personally identifiable information.
- **How we use it:** Understand site performance and improve content. Analytics are evaluated in aggregate only.
- **Opt-out:** Plausible is cookieless. If we introduce additional trackers that use cookies, we will update this policy and provide consent controls.

## 2. How We Use Information
- Fulfil product orders and provide customer service.
- Send marketing communications (with opt-out controls for newsletters).
- Improve site content, navigation, and product offerings based on aggregated analytics insights.
- Comply with legal obligations, including tax reporting and fraud prevention.

## 3. Sharing of Information
- We share data only with service providers required to operate the business (Formspree, Snipcart, Stripe/PayPal, Plausible, and our email marketing vendor).
- We do not sell personal information. If we collaborate with marketing partners in the future, we will document those relationships here and offer appropriate consent mechanisms.

## 4. Data Retention
- **Contact form submissions:** Retained for up to 90 days unless a longer conversation is active.
- **Order records:** Stored for seven years to satisfy accounting and regulatory requirements.
- **Newsletter subscribers:** Retained until a subscriber opts out or requests deletion.

## 5. Your Rights
- **Access and correction:** Email [hola@creacionescolibri.com](mailto:hola@creacionescolibri.com) to request a copy of your data or corrections.
- **Deletion:** Contact us to request deletion of your information (subject to legal retention requirements for orders).
- **Unsubscribe:** Use the link in marketing emails to opt out at any time.

## 6. Data Security
- Secrets and credentials are managed according to our [secrets management guidelines](../docs/operations/secrets-management.md).
- Snipcart and payment gateways handle PCI compliance and secure payment processing.
- Dashboard access is restricted to authorized team members using multi-factor authentication.

## 7. International Data Transfers
- Service providers may process data in the United States or other regions. We rely on their contractual safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses and SOC 2 compliance) to protect transferred data.

## 8. Updates to This Policy
- We review this policy during launch readiness and whenever new tools or data flows are introduced.
- All updates are documented in our repository history. Material changes will be noted prominently on this page.
